===== CSS PROPERTY EXPLORATION ACTIVITY
A list of questions for each breakout room is listed below.
Decide as a group how to best divide up your breakout room questions between group members.
Individuals/groups of team members will then research answers to a question and prepare coding
examples (where applicable) to best illustrate the topic/answer.
Some questions are harder than others so if you finish early, assist other group members with answering additional/harder questions.
Collaborate with your group and share with each other what you found in researching your questions.
Designate one or two presenters in the group to present the findings of the group to the class.
If your group finishes early, feel free to help out other groups.
We will begin group presentations at 3:00PM.
Aim to present for around 5 minutes or less and expect questions.
